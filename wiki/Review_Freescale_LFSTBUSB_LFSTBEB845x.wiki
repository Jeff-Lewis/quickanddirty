There are no CD/DVD or USB-sticks with datasheets and no real-value information inside. A CD or USB-stick with a regular HTML5+CSS3 website inside and those datasheets in PDF would be great. As well as other supporting software. Note also that no Flash or Silverlight should be used on possible CD/DVD or USB-stick.. Should work on all platforms.

= Using the Kit - LFSTBUSB =
== Without Reading the Online Manual ==
=== Information in the Quick Start Guide ===
==== Steps ====
  # Unpack the board. Verify package contents according to the kit website: freescale.com/sensortoolbox
  # At freescale.com/sensortoolbox download the latest software version by clicking: Download Software
  # Plug in the USB and turn the board on using the power switch. Run the Sensor Toolbox link on your desktop.
==== Comments ====
I would expect to see an assembly guide and usage information. And then as in more details on website. The facts are missing and seems more like a marketing flyer. Seems to rely heavily on Microsoft Windows. Having only a written links to a website is not a good thing, as Freescale might be upgrading their website in the near future and then all things might not be there anymore.. 

=== Connecting to Linux ===
==== Steps ====
  # Connect usb cable between LFSTBUSB and your Linux laptop
  # Switch power on @ LFSTBUSB

Same flyer as in the LFSTBUSB, except picture has been changed. And same comments for this as well. Why to provide a Quick Start Guide, if you are not going to provide anything else than a website address and why to make an operating system specific presumptions. And if the information is only available from the website, what happens in few years, is the url still valid, I doubt. As this is for prototyping and concepting we should have some kind of long-term solution for having the datasheets are related technical information in-hand. The CD/DVD or USB-stick would provide at least one way ticket for the years to come.

=== Connecting to LFSTBUSB ===
==== Steps ====
  # Make sure that LFSTBUSB is disconnected from laptop
  # Select accelerometer DIP (MMA8451Q,MMA8452Q or MMA8453Q)
  # Insert LFSTBEB845x to LFSTBUSB
  # Insert DIP to LFSTBEB845x
=== Comments ===
You need to be sure that you insert the DIP to LFSTBEB845x in right way. Note that there are ID's for the sockets on the PCB. Make sure that J1 and J2 are going to matching sockets on both PCBs. The DIP has been also shaped in that way that the outer sides will match, one side of the DIP is longer and should be pointing inwards. Another thing to be noted is that LFSTBEB845x has a lot of SMD components on the backside, so that has to be inserted first to the LFSTBUSB other wise you can damage them by accident. When the LFSTBEB845x and LFSTBUSB have been connected together you can connect the DIP more safer.

= Following the Quick Start Guide =
  # opening the url to [http://www.freescale.com/sensortoolbox freescale.com/sensortoolbox]
  # clicking the blue _button_ which says: Download Software.

  * This is totally useless for me. 
  * I dont use Windows and the Download Software takes me to License Agreement page from which it will push SensorToolbox.exe to me..
  * I just wonder if I can find some PDF files or manuals from the website.
  * Maybe the SensorToolbox.exe will run with Wine..
