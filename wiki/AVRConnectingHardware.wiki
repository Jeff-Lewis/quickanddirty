With relays you can control several different devices. According to [http://www.sanyourelay.ca/public/products/product_list_new.php?series=43&listby=0 Sanyou] the typical applications are:
  * Home appliances, Air conditioner,heater,etc.
  * Office machines, PC, facsimile, etc.
  * Vending machine
  * Automotive Power-window, car antenna,door-lock,etc.
But the point is that a relay is just _a switch_. You can use lower voltage to switch higher voltage/current devices.

{{{
1 | Output Load 1 (default state)
2 | Output Load 2
3 | to AVR PIN
4 | Input Load
5 | to AVR GND
}}}
If you want to switch the Load ON when the AVR has power then connect the Load between _Output Load 2_ and _Input Load_. In this way you can switch the Load ON by setting _AVR PIN_ to HIGH.
