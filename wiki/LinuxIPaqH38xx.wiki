#summary Replacing Windows CE with Linux

= Introduction =

small quick-and-dirty wiki page, which should contain at least links how to do it.
Opie is Qt-based embedded Linux distribution which has been endorsed by handhelds.org, but nowadays it is more or less obsolete. :)

= What can you do with this? =
One good reason why you might want to replace the old Pocket PC operating system with Linux, if you are interested to have small Linux server with touch screen for your projects.

= What next? =
I guess I will enable that USB Networking and connect the device to a NSLU2 which runs already Linux as well and then I will share that Internet connection from there using that one and enable Console access to iPaq using Serial-2-USB adapter.

= How did I do it? =
  # Install new boot loader to the Pocket PC.
  # Flash linux jffi2 partition

= Serial settings for serial console =

  * Data bits: 8
  * Parity: None
  * Stop bits: 1
