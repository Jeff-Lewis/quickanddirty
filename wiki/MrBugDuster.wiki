= Introduction =

The short idea is to have a remote controlled robot.


= Hardware =
|| Name || Amount || Purpose || Price ||
|| 5mm RGB Led || 6 || Debug lights, driving lights, etc || 1-5e each ||
|| Parallax Continuous Servo || 2 || controlled wheels || 10e each ||
|| ball caster || 1 || wheel || 3e ||
|| ATtiny2313 || 1 || support cpu - wheel and light controller || 1-4e ||
|| ATmega8 || 1 || main cpu || 1-6e ||
|| Wii Nunchuk Controller || 1 || The remote controller and accelerometer  || 6e for wired, 10e for wireless in konebox.fi ||
|| Resistors || n || for leds and etc. || ~1e ||

= Software =
C Language for the on-board microprocessors. PWM for Leds and Servos. I2C protocol for support cpu => main cpu communication and between remote controller => main cpu.

= Communication =

|| Led || Mode || Color || Triggered On Action ||
|| Front Left || Blink || Yellow || Turn left ||
|| Front Right || Blink || Yellow || Turn right ||
|| Middle Left || Blink || Yellow || Turn left ||
|| Middle Right || Blink || Yellow || Turn right ||
|| Rear Left || Blink || Yellow || Turn left ||
|| Rear Right || Blink || Yellow || Turn right ||
